# doxycannon

Doxycannon takes a pool of OpenVPN files and creates a Docker container for each one that binds a
socks server to a host port. Combined with proxychains, this creates your very own cheap and fast
private botnet.

## Prerequisites
- Install the required pip modules:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Ensure docker is installed and enables. Refer to the [Wiki](../../wiki/installing-docker)
for installation on Kali/Debian
- `proxychains4` is required for interactive mode

## Setup
- Create a `VPN` folder in the root of the project 
- Fill it with `*.ovpn` files and ensure that the `auth-user-pass` directive
  in your `./VPN/*.ovpn` files says `auth-user-pass auth.txt`
   - Watch [this wiki section](../../wiki#getting-started-with-vpn-providers) for installation tips for
     individual VPN providers
- Create an `auth.txt` file with your ovpn credentials in `VPN`
- Run `./doxycannon.sh -b` to build your image
- Run `./doxycannon.sh -u` to bring your containers up
- Run `./doxycannon.sh -d` to bring your containers down

## Usage

_note: the way proxychains seeds its PRNG to choose a random proxy is not fast enough to ensure
each subsequent request goes out through a different IP. You may get about between 2-10 requests
being made from the same IP. If this is unacceptable, check out my fork at
http://github.com/audibleblink/proxychains_

### One-off, random commands
While your containers are up, you can use proxychains to issue commands through random proxies

```sh
proxychains4 -q curl -s ipconfing.io/json
proxychains4 -q hydra -L users.txt -p Winter2018 manager.example.com -t 8 ssh
proxychains4 -q gobuster -w word.list -h http://manager.example.com
```

### GUI Tools
In this repo, checkout out the [haproxy](haproxy) folder to create a proxy rotator. This will allow
you rotate through your proxies from a single port which means you can point your browsers or
BURPSuite instances at it and have every request use a different VPN.

### Specific SOCKS proxies
If you want to use a specific proxy, give your utility the proper SOCKS port.

Example: To make a request through Japan, use `docker ps` to find the local port the Japanese proxy is
bound to.

Then configure you tool to use that port:

```sh
curl --socks5 localhost:50xx ipconfig.io/json
```

### Interactive
Once you've built your image and started your containers, run the utility with the `--interactive`
flag to get a bash session where all network traffic is redirected through proxychains4

```sh
./doxycannon.sh -i
```

### Credit
[pry0cc](https://github.com/pry0cc/ProxyDock) for the idea

This was originally a fork of pry0cc's ProxyDock. It's been modified to an extent where less than
1% of the original code remains.

## TODO

- [X] Interactive mode
- [X] Python management script
  - [X] Faster Up/Down Container management
  - [ ] Allow for management of remote doxycannon installs through the Docker API

- [X] Dispatch server - (will allow GUI applications to use doxycannon)
  - [X] Creates a single local proxy server that dispatches through VPNs
